# fortune-mod-minecraft-movie
quotes from A Minecraft Movie (2025) that you can use in the `fortune` command.
## How to use
(assuming you have fortune installed already) <br/>
```
  cd /usr/share/fortune
  wget https://github.com/bean-frog/fortune-mod-minecraft-movie/raw/refs/heads/main/minecraftmovie
  wget https://github.com/bean-frog/fortune-mod-minecraft-movie/raw/refs/heads/main/minecraftmovie.dat
```
- if you run just the fortune command with no args, it will choose a random fortune file from this directory
- to use only this file, use `fortune minecraftmovie`
- this is incredibly stupid but also kinda funny
